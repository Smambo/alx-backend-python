### Python - Async <br><br>

For this project, we will be making use of the `asyncio` [library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html).<br>
The library is used to write <b>concurrent</b> code using the <b>async/await</b> syntax.
asyncio is used as a foundation for multiple Python asynchronous frameworks that provide high-performance network and web-servers, database connection libraries, distributed task queues, etc.
